<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Cottage Garden originated in </span><span class="s2">England</span><span class="s1"> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained </span><span class="s2">English estate gardens</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</span></p>
