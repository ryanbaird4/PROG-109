	<h1>It Might as Well Be <strong><em>Spring</em></strong></h1>
    <h2>Song by Frank Sinatra</h2>
    <p>I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm<br>
    I'm as jumpy as puppet on a string<br>
    I'd say that I had <strong><em>spring</em></strong> fever<br>
    But I know it isn't <strong><em>spring</em></strong><br>
    I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented<br>
    Like a nightingale without a song to sing<br>
	O why should I have <strong><em>spring</em></strong> fever<br>
	When it isn't even <strong><em>spring</em></strong><br>
	I keep I were someone else<br>
	Walking down a strange new street<br>
	And hearing words that I've never head<br>
	From a girl I've yet to meet<br>
	I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams<br>
	Spinning spinning daydreams<br>
	I'm as giggy as a baby on a swing<br>
	I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud<br>
	Or a robin on the wing<br>
	But I feel so gay in a melancholy way<br>
	That it might as well be <strong><em>spring</em></strong><br>
	It might as<br>
	Well be<br>
	<strong><em>Spring</em></strong>
   </p>
