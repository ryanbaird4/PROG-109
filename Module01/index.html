  <h1>Module 01 - Introduction to Web Development: HTML</h1>
  <h2>
    	In this module, we learned about how the internet works. We also learned about structure of a web page using HTML. By using HTML, one can create different forms of text, lists, links, and images.<br>
	These first five chapters were tough to grasp at first, but once the pieces came together it seems amazing how a webpage (and website directory) are put together.
