    <p>A succulent, moist, easy-to-make chicken.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>6 skinless chicken thighs</li>
     </ul>
     <ol>
     	<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic powder, rosemary, salt, and pepper; simmer until flavors combine, about 1 minute. Stir in honey; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Dip chicken into sauce, 1 piece at a time, until coated. Place chicken on a 9x13-inch baking pan; pour remaining sauce over chicken.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from oven; immediately turn over chicken with tongs to coat the top with sauce.</li>
     </ol>
